# NorSand

The bonded NorSand model is an extension of the original critical state based constitutive model NorSand by Jefferies (1993). Relevant equations are presented briefly on this document.

## Yield Function

$$ F = \frac{q}{p+p_c} - \frac{M_\theta}{N}\left[1 + (N-1)\left(\frac{p + p_c}{p_i + p_c + p_d}\right)^\frac{N}{1-N}\right] $$

$$M(\theta) = M_{tc} - \frac{M_{tc}^2}{3 + M_{tc}}cos(\frac{3\theta}{2})$$

where $p$ is the mean pressure, $q$ is the magnitude of deviatoric stress, $\theta$ is the Lode's angle (with cosine convention), $M$ is the slope of the critical line, $M_{tc}$ is the value of $M$ under trial extension status. Furthermore, $p_c$ and $p_d$ are cohesive and dilative pressure terms to describe the bond. They are defined as:

$$ p_c = p_{c0} \exp{(-m_c \varepsilon^p_d)} $$

$$ p_d = p_{d0} \exp{(-m_d \varepsilon^p_d)} $$

where $p_{c0}$ is the initial cohesive pressure term, $p_{d0}$ is the initial dilative pressure term, $m_c$ is cohesive degradation term and $m_d$ is dilative degradation term. Lastly, $\varepsilon^p_d$ is the equivalent plastic deviatoric strain. 

## Flow Rule

An assosiated potential flow rules is defined, which means it has the same format with the yield function.

## Elastic Modulus

The bulk and shear modulus are defined as follow, with an assumption of constant Poisson's ratio $\nu$.

$$ K = \frac{1 + e}{\kappa}p + m_M (p_c + p_d) $$

$$ G = \frac{3K(1 - 2\nu)}{2(1+\nu)} $$

where $e$ is the void ratio, $\kappa$ is the swell/recompression index,, $K$ is the volumetric modulus, and finally $G$ is the shear modulus.


## Input Parameters

An example input JSON is given as follow for 3D bonded model. Note that `tolerance` is an optional parameter.

For traditional NorSand (Jefferies, 1993), `bond_model` is set to be `false`. The code could also take a simpler and reduced input such as follow. Note that `tolerance` is also optional along with the other six variables.
